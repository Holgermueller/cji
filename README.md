# CJI

## Community Justice Investigations

I built this site on behalf of Community Justice Investigations, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, operating in the Twin Cities Metro Area of Minnesota.

Since I no longer live in the Twin Cities, I worked with CJI remotely.

I used Wordpress/Elementor to build the site. It was my first time using these technologies. Once I got the hand of how everything worked, I found them pretty easy to use.

While they don't involve too much coding, it is helpful to have some knowledge of design and development standards.

Things I took into consideration include:
- Proper use of html headings
- Color contrast for accessability
- Acceptable spacing and font size to make sure text is readable
- Making sure to use percentages, VH, em, and rem to ensure seemless mobile responsitivity
